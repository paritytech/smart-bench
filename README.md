# smart-bench :brain:

> Measure the end-to-end throughput of smart contracts.

## Usage

If you're not interested into compilation of this software natively on your PC but would like to leverage dockerized solution please find more information within [launch](./launch/README.md) subdirectory of this project.

### Installation 

Currently, this tool must be run directly via cargo, because it requires access to the predefined wasm contract binaries in the `contracts` directory. 

So first clone this repo and run: `cargo run --release -- --help` which should give info for the args:

```
USAGE:
    smart-bench [OPTIONS] --instance-count <INSTANCE_COUNT> --call-count <CALL_COUNT> <CHAIN> [CONTRACTS]...

ARGS:
    <CHAIN>           the smart contract platform to benchmark [possible values: ink-wasm, sol-wasm, evm]
    <CONTRACTS>...    the list of contracts to benchmark with [possible values: erc20, flipper,
                      incrementer, erc721, erc1155, odd-product, triangle-number, storage-read,
                      storage-write, storage-read-write]

OPTIONS:
    -c, --call-count <CALL_COUNT>
            the number of calls to make to each contract

    -h, --help
            Print help information

    -i, --instance-count <INSTANCE_COUNT>
            the number of each contract to instantiate

        --url <url>
            the url of the substrate node for submitting the extrinsics [default:
            ws://localhost:9944]

    -V, --version
            Print version information

```

### Node binaries

- To quickly download node binaries, consider using helper [download](./launch/download-bins.sh) script. It will download all required files with predefined versions in the `launch/bin` directory.
  ```
  (cd launch && ./download-bins.sh)
  ```
- You can also use binaries provided on your own as long as these are to be found using standard PATH variable based mechanism. In such case you must also consider possible compatibility issues between various versions of binaries used.
  - Please NOTE: For a local `moonbeam` parachain setup for EVM contracts, `moonbeam` node is required to have dev RPC endpoint enabled. This feature is not part of an official release and requires source code change and compilation (find example changes avaiable at [commit](https://github.com/PureStake/moonbeam/commit/decd8774bdc100670f86f293d8f145720290faef)). This will also require building the `polkadot` relay-chain node from source at the same commit as the polkadot dependencies for the `moonbeam` binary.

### Launching the local test network

Eventually, `smart-bench` requires to provide it with URL address of web socket port for running pallet-contracts compatible node. It should work fine as long as you have such node started by any means.

Following are example steps to start the network from scratch using `zombienet` project:
1. Make sure you have `zombienet` binary available on your local machine. It will be already available at `launch/bin` directory if you decided to use [download](./launch/download-bins.sh) script mentioned above. You could also download existing release or compile from sources by following offical [zombienet](https://github.com/paritytech/zombienet) github page documentation. 
2. Launch the local network ***(consider changing `PATH` accordingly for any custom usage scenarios)***
  - Wasm contracts with pallet-contracts: 
    ```
    PATH="launch/bin:$PATH" zombienet -p native spawn launch/configs/network_native_wasm.toml
    ```
  - EVM contracts on a moonbeam node:
    ```
    PATH="launch/bin:$PATH" zombienet -p native spawn launch/configs/network_native_moonbeam.toml
    ```
3. Wait for `Network launched ðŸš€ðŸš€` message
4. Node is now available at `ws://localhost:9988` (TCP port numer is defined as part of config file)

### Running benchmarks

`smart-bench` works on a pre-defined set of contracts, and the user can specify which contract(s) should be tested, and how many instances and number of calls should be executed. e.g.

`cargo run --release -- ink-wasm erc20 erc1155 --instance-count 10 --call-count 20 --url ws://localhost:9988`

The above will create 10 instances of each of the `erc20` and `erc1155` contracts, and call each of those instances 20 times (400 total calls). Once all the calls have been submitted, the block stats should appear on the console e.g.

```
0005: PoV Size=0130KiB(005%) Weight RefTime=0000088ms(017%) Weight ProofSize=3277KiB(064%) Witness=0119KiB Block=0011KiB NumExtrinsics=0048
0006: PoV Size=0130KiB(005%) Weight RefTime=0000088ms(017%) Weight ProofSize=3277KiB(064%) Witness=0118KiB Block=0011KiB NumExtrinsics=0048
0007: PoV Size=0130KiB(005%) Weight RefTime=0000088ms(017%) Weight ProofSize=3277KiB(064%) Witness=0119KiB Block=0011KiB NumExtrinsics=0048
0008: PoV Size=0130KiB(005%) Weight RefTime=0000088ms(017%) Weight ProofSize=3277KiB(064%) Witness=0118KiB Block=0011KiB NumExtrinsics=0048
```
One row per block, showing the % usage of the PoV size and the block weight, as well as the number of extrinsics executed per block. Note the Weight % is expected to max out at 75%, since that is the ratio of the total block weight assigned to "normal" i.e. the user submitted/non-operational class of extrinsics.

#### Ink!/Wasm contracts

Currently the Wasm contracts are the `contracts/ink/*.contract` files, some of which have been compiled from https://github.com/paritytech/ink/tree/master/examples and committed to this repository. So in order to modify these they can compiled locally and copied over to the `contracts/ink` dir. There are also two locally defined custom contracts in the `contracts/ink` folder: `computation` and `storage` for testing pure computation and storage operations.

#### Solidity/EVM contracts

Before running the benchmarks against a `pallet-evm` enabled network, the solidity contracts must first be compiled:

- Install hardhat https://hardhat.org/getting-started
- `cd contracts/solidity && npx hardhat compile`

Now make sure the target EVM enabled network is up and running as specified above, and this time change the value of the first argument to `evm`:

`cargo run --release -- evm erc20 erc1155 --instance-count 10 --call-count 20 --url ws://localhost:9988`

#### Solang - Solidity/Wasm contracts

Before running benchmark against a `pallet-contract` enabled network, Solang contract needs to be compiled.
The easiest way to compile the contracts is to do this having Solidity/EVM compiled first.
After this the `openzeppelin_solang.patch` needs to be applied:
`cd contracts/solidity/node_modules/@openzeppelin && patch -p1 < ../../openzeppelin_solang.patch`
Finally a Solang contract can be compiled using command:
`cd contracts/solidity/wasm/ && solang compile --release --wasm-opt z --target polkadot --importmap @openzeppelin=../node_modules/@openzeppelin/   ./../contracts/BenchERC1155.sol`
Currently [`solang`](https://github.com/hyperledger/solang) compiler needs to be built from sources including [`U256 type fix commit`](https://github.com/smiasojed/solang/commit/467b25ab3d44884e643e3217ac16c56c5788dccc)


### Integration tests

Smart-bench contains integrations tests, which can be run using command `cargo test`.
Before running tests, smart-bench needs to be build using `cargo build` command.
Integration tests requires two types of nodes to be installed and available on `PATH`.
- [`moonbeam`](https://github.com/PureStake/moonbeam/) with enabled [`dev RPC`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-contracts-node/blob/539cf0271090f406cb3337e4d97680a6a63bcd2f/node/src/rpc.rs#L60) for Solidity/EVM contracts
- [`substrate-contracts-node`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-contracts-node/) for Ink! and Solang (Solidity/Wasm) contracts
