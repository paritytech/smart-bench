## Overview

This directory contains docker related scripts and configurations to compile and run smart-bench as Docker Image. Resulting image and toolings available here are meant to be used in scenarios where consistent results are required such as CI/CD systems, but also for rapid testing on environments where there is no interest of setting up rust or any other compile prerequisites. Clients of the image will also benefit from not being required to track current recommendations for toolchain configurations or version changes and any compatibility issues that can arise from that, it can be expected that project will compile and run out of the box.

The environment is created as Docker Image (by default named and tagged as `smart-bench:latest`) which leverages multi-stage Docker builds. Helper scripts available in this directory streamline operations to build ([build.sh](./build.sh)) and run ([run.sh](./run.sh)) of the image.

At the first stage of docker build, based upon `docker.io/paritytech/ci-unified:bullseye-1.74.0` as rust enabled compilation env, smart-bench software is being compiled from current sources (this git repository). Resulting binary is copied into second stage / final docker image based on `ubuntu:20.04` image where also other dependencies are configured and installed.

Final image consists of few pieces that are integrated into it: 
- `polkadot`, `polkadot-parachain`, `polkadot-execute-worker`, `polkadot-prepare-worker` and `zombienet` pre-compiled binaries taken from offical releases
- `moonbeam` binary provided by custom release created on [this fork](https://github.com/karolk91/moonbeam) (custom fork was required to enable dev rpc module which is not supported by offical releases)
- pre-compiled smart contracts available within this repository at [contracts](../contracts/) dir
- [entrypoint.sh](./entrypoint.sh) script that orchestrates running of the above to eventually receive benchmarking results from `smart-bench` itself. The script accepts set of parameters to be passed as-is to `smart-bench` app. It runs zombienet as a background job and starts smart-bench while providing it with correct parameters to reach to zombienet nodes.

Please refer to the [download-bin.sh](./download-bin.sh) script for detailed info about source of download for binary components

It is possible to run `smart-bench:latest` using raw `docker run` command with options (see examples below) but usage of `run.sh` can abstract away some of the internals of the image and also result in better compatibility with future image versions. The `run.sh` currently helps with following usage scenarios:
1. use `smart-bench:latest` image as is, composed of specific versions of nodes and contracts
1. use `smart-bench:latest` for what it consists of but provide custom set of pre-compiled contracts
1. use `smart-bench:latest` but provide custom set of node binaries (`polkadot`, `zombienet` `polkadot-parachain`, `polkadot-execute-worker`, `polkadot-prepare-worker`, `moonbeam`)
1. use `smart-bench:latest` but provide custom zombienet config

Usage scenarios above are possible by providing volume mounts arguments to `docker run`, to override specific locations within the resulting container filesystem. And this is exactly what `run.sh` is doing under the hood for you when providing optional parameters (see usage below) to the script.


## Usage
### Step 1. Build image

a) downloads dependencies
```
./download-bins.sh
```

b) build smart-bench:latest image
```
./build.sh
```

or build using manual VERSION, eg. smart-bench:1.0 image
```
VERSION=1.0 ./build.sh
```


### Step 2. Run image
#### `run.sh` help screen:
```
Usage: ./run.sh OPTION -- ARGUMENTS_TO_SMART_BENCH

OPTION
 -b, --binaries-dir   (Optional) Path to directory that contains binaries to mount into the container (eg. polkadot, zombienet, moonbeam)
                      List of binaries being used depends on config provided. Default set of binaries is available within the image
 -t, --contracts-dir  (Optional) Path to directory that contains compiled smart contracts. Default set of compiled smart contracts is available within the image
 -u, --configs-dir    (Optional) Path to directory that contains zombienet config files. Default set of configs files is available within the image
 -h, --help           Print this help message

ARGUMENTS_TO_SMART_BENCH
  smart-bench specific parameters (NOTE: do not provide --url param as it is managed by this tool)

EXAMPLES
./run.sh -- evm erc20 --instance-count 1 --call-count 10
./run.sh -- ink-wasm erc20 --instance-count 1 --call-count 10
./run.sh -- sol-wasm erc20 --instance-count 1 --call-count 10
./run.sh --binaries-dir=./bin -- sol-wasm erc20 --instance-count 1 --call-count 10
./run.sh --contracts-dir=../contracts -- sol-wasm erc20 --instance-count 1 --call-count 10
./run.sh --configs-dir=./configs -- sol-wasm erc20 --instance-count 1 --call-count 10
```

## run examples
Following are examples of running `smart-bench:latest` image using either `run.sh` wrapper script or raw `docker run` commands equivalents (see expandable sections)

---

### Scenario 1. Running smart-bench without overriding any binaries or configurations:

```
./run.sh -- evm erc20 --instance-count 1 --call-count 10
```
<details>
<summary>expand</summary>

```
docker run --rm -it --init smart-bench:latest evm erc20 --instance-count 1 --call-count 10
```
</details>

---
### Scenario 2. Override binaries:
```
./run.sh --binaries-dir=./bin -- sol-wasm erc20 --instance-count 1 --call-count 10
```
<details>
<summary>expand</summary>

```
docker run --rm -it --init -v $PWD/bin:/usr/local/smart-bench/bin smart-bench:latest sol-wasm erc20 --instance-count 1 --call-count 10
```
</details>

---

### Scenario 3. Override contracts

NOTE: please note that smart-bench application expects some particular hierarchy of files in context of contracts directory and it must be preserved when creating other one to override. Please consult hierarchy available at [contracts](../contracts/) which is also part of this git repository. It might be easier to create copy of the one mentioned and modify only the parts of interest / to override.
```
./run.sh --contracts-dir=../contracts -- sol-wasm erc20 --instance-count 1 --call-count 10
```
<details>
<summary>expand</summary>

```
docker run --rm -it --init -v $PWD/../contracts:/usr/local/smart-bench/contracts smart-bench:latest sol-wasm erc20 --instance-count 1 --call-count 10
```
</details>

---

### Scenario 4. Override configs
```
./run.sh --configs-dir=./configs -- sol-wasm erc20 --instance-count 1 --call-count 10
```
<details>
<summary>expand</summary>

```
docker run --rm -it --init -v $PWD/configs:/usr/local/smart-bench/config smart-bench:latest sol-wasm erc20 --instance-count 1 --call-count 10
```
</details>

## Miscellaneous

### Generate list of pre-funded accounts
Following are optional steps that can be used to re-generate list of pre-funded accounts used for benchmarking

create python environment
```
make setup
```

make sure to activate python env
```
source venv/bin/activate
```

use scripts to generate json list of balances
```
# moonbeam / evm
python eth_addr_generator.py > configs/funded-accounts-evm.json

# substrate / wasm
python substrate_addr_generator.py > configs/funded-accounts-wasm.json
```

### Moonbeam with Dev RPC module enabled build recipe

Following is an example recipe how to build moonbeam binary with Dev RPC module enabled
```
git clone https://github.com/PureStake/moonbeam.git
cd moonbeam && git fetch https://github.com/karolk91/moonbeam master && git cherry-pick decd877
